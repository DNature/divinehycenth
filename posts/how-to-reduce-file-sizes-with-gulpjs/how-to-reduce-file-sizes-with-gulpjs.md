## To start — what is gulp?

Gulp is a JavaScript task runner that lets you automate tasks such as…

- Bundling and minifying libraries and stylesheets.
- Refreshing your browser when you save a file.
- Quickly running unit tests.
- Running code analysis.
- And much more!

An alternative to Gulp is [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/)
