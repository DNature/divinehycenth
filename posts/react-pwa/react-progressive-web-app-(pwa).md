## What is a Progressive Web Application (PWA)

<br/>

> A progressive web app (PWA) is the set of mobile web application development techniques that entails building apps that feel and look like native ones. Using a web stack (JS, HTML, and CSS), progressive web apps combine a rich functionality and smooth user experience associated with native apps. Simply put, PWA is the web app with the native-app flavor: After the installation, a user clicks on its icon on a device home screen and gets straight to the website.

Progressive web apps provides huge benefits like:

<br/>

- **Self-updates:** Able to update themselves automatically, apps stay fresh.

<br/>

- **Cross platform compatibility:** These apps are built according to progressive enhancement principles. Progressive enhancement is the web design strategy of providing the basic functionality and content to everyone regardless of browsers they use or connection quality while delivering more sophisticated page versions to users whose newer browsers can support them.

<br/>

- **App-like experience:** It provides the feels and looks of a native mobile application.

<br/>

- **Offline Support:** Your application can work offline except the page requires a real time data fetching.
