- [About me](#)
- [My technology stack](#my-technology-stack)

My love for computers started when I got exposed to computers in my primary
school and I became more curious about it.

When I was 9years old, My parent's enrolled me in a 6-month Bootcamp where I
learned basic things and how to use base office software like Microsoft office
suite and CorelDraw. After 6 months, I came out with a Diploma certificate in
basic computer operations. I was the youngest and the age difference between me
and other students was about 8 to 10 years. I was supposed to be introduced to
basic internet surfing but they skipped that session.

After a while, My parents got me a

to keep practicing and that's where figured out how to use the internet on my
own and I wanted to know more about the internet works.

During my holidays in secondary school, I spend most of my time teaching people
how to use computers at the Bootcamp I graduated from, and as soon I finished
secondary school at 15, I was offered a full-time position to teach people how
to operate computers. I got to know about Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.
I was able to save some money, and my father gave me more money to be able to
buy my second laptop (HP Pavilion DV6700) that I used to advance my graphic
design skill.

At age 16, I was offered a job as a Graphic designer in a large format printing
press (Marfex) where I got to know about different forms of printing. I was also
able to operate heavy machines like

[Bizhub C554](https://www.abdofficesolutions.com/collections/refurbished-konica-minolta-copiers-printers/products/konica-minolta-bizhub-c554),
etc, within a short time.

I met a lot of successful self-taught programmers and a few CS graduates during
my stay at Marfex that gave me the same advice. They said that although most
people feel that a CS student should be able to write code, it is far from
reality because they do not teach you how to program in the university.

Fortunately, I landed a contract to print some flex(banners) during a
presidential election through which I made enough money to buy a better laptop
([HP Probook 440 G1](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Flaptoping.com%2Fspecs%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F04%2FHP-ProBook-440-G1.png&f=1&nofb=1))
before I resigned from my job to pursue my career as a software developer.

After what looks like forever, I landed my first Full-stack job at Dreamworks
systems solution. I don't want to talk about Dreamworks because the company does
a lot of things like computer networking, government contracts, etc. After being
involved in two projects, I became the lead software engineer in 2019 at
Dreamworks.

I resigned from my job at Dreamworks in early 2020 and then I got into my first
open-source project ([Combat Covid](https://combatcovid.equipment)). After that,
I was hired to work on an open-source project
([Hardocs](https://hardocs.github.io)) funded by TU Delft and EOSC in June 2020.

Also, I want to mention that I started to build
[Nature UI](https://nature-ui.com) before my contract to build Hardocs and the
first version of [Nature UI](https://nature-ui.com) was released in the first
week of February 2021.

I resumed playing football in 2020 and why I stopped playing football in 2016
was because I had an accident that affected my right foot which is completely
gone right now.

## My technology stack.

Programming Languages:

1. Javascript
2. Typescript
3. Python (Entry Level)

Here are a few technologies I use to build front-end applications:

1. React.
2. Next.js
3. Redux.
4. Apollo + Graphql.
5. HTML + CSS
6. Vuejs
7. Nuxt.js.

Below are a few technologies I use to develop server-side applications:

1. Node.js.
2. Graphql + Apollo
3. Express.
4. Postgresql
5. MongoDB
6. Couch + Pouch DB
7. Django
8. Firebase

I use mostly use `Jest` for testing on both front-end and back-end; However, I
use `react-testing-library`, `enzyme` for other forms of testing.

I use Docker and other docker-related tools and Nginx for DevOps. Although, I
have used Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and CorelDraw in the past, I
prefer to create UI designs with Figma.

I use git + GitHub for version control and Github actions or Travis CI for
CI/CD.

My current website is built with [Nature UI](https://nature-ui.com), Next.js,
and React and it's powered by markdown.

I plan to update this page as time goes on so stay tuned ðŸ™‚.
