          <p>
            Iâ€™m Divine Hycenth, a full stack software developer, technical
            writer, and UI/UX Designer. I currently spend most of my time
            programming in <b>_JavaScript/TypeScript_</b> for three (3) years
            and writing about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also do some <b>python, DevOps(Docker)</b> stuffs when the need
            arises.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            I'm very passionate about software development and I would love to
            join you to grow and improve your beautiful ideas. I am open to
            roles like <b>full stack, back end or front end.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm <b>self motivated</b> which makes me competent and also a great fit for a
            <b> remote</b> job and i would love to relocate if i'm required to.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started this website as a place to document everything I learned
            while going through a career change.
